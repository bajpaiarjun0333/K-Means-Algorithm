# K-Means-Algorithm
The implementation of the K Means machine learning algorithm for unstructured data. 
In this python project i have seperated the 3 data points generated with some noise and some bias based on the group they fall into  
We have 3 mean points in the projet which reshift themselves while the code is being executed.
